RF430FRL15xH Integration for CGM App
Objective: Implement NFC-based communication between a smartphone app (Android/iOS) and the Texas Instruments RF430FRL15xH sensor to read glucose data from an analog glucose sensor for a Continuous Glucose Monitor (CGM) application.

Assumptions:

The glucose sensor is connected to ADC0 of the RF430FRL152H, outputting 0 to 0.9 V, with a bandwidth <1 Hz.
The RF430FRL152H operates in passive mode (RF-powered) or with a 1.5-V battery (e.g., silver-oxide SR626).
Firmware uses the “Default” or “SensorHub” project for ROM-based ADC sampling, unless NDEF mode is preferred.
The app will handle glucose calibration (voltage to mg/dL or mmol/L conversion) based on sensor-specific parameters.
1. NFC Communication Protocol
Details to Pass:

Standard: ISO/IEC 15693 (13.56 MHz).
Commands:
Write Single Block: Command code 0x21, used to configure ADC and initiate sampling.
Read Single Block: Command code 0x20, used to retrieve ADC results.
Flags: Use high data rate (0x02) for all commands to optimize speed.
Smartphone NFC:
Android: Use NfcV.transceive() for ISO/IEC 15693 commands.
iOS: Use NFCISO15693Tag in Core NFC.
Range: Expect ~5–9 cm in passive mode; ensure app alerts user if out of range.
Implementation Notes:
Send commands in sequence: configure ADC, start sampling, read result.
Wait ~1 second after starting sampling due to ADC conversion time.
Action for Cursor:

Implement NFC reader mode to send/receive ISO/IEC 15693 commands.
Handle errors for NFC signal loss or invalid responses.
Test commands with a smartphone NFC stack to confirm reliability.
2. Data Format and Structure
Details to Pass:

Memory:
Data stored in FRAM (nonvolatile).
Virtual registers start at address 0xF868 (Block 0x00 for RFID).
ADC results for ADC0 (glucose sensor) stored in Block 0x09.
Block Format:
Block size: 8 bytes (default for RF430FRL152HEVM GUI compatibility).
Example Read Response (Block 0x09):
text

Copy
[00 90 24 FF FF FF FF FF]
Bytes 0–2: ADC result (e.g., 0x2490 = 9360 decimal, 14-bit).
Bytes 3–7: Unused (0xFF = don’t care).
Glucose Data:
ADC result (0 to 16383) maps to 0 to 0.9 V.
Conversion Formula (to be finalized with sensor datasheet):
text

Copy
Voltage = (ADC_result / 16383) * 0.9
Glucose (mg/dL) = f(Voltage)  // Sensor-specific calibration, e.g., (Voltage / 0.1) * 100
Alternative (NDEF Mode):
If using “NFC” firmware:
Data formatted as NDEF message (e.g., text record: “Glucose: 9360”).
App reads NDEF directly, parses ADC value, and converts to glucose.
Action for Cursor:

Parse Block 0x09 response to extract 14-bit ADC result (first 3 bytes, little-endian).
Implement voltage calculation: Voltage = (ADC_result / 16383) * 0.9.
Add placeholder for glucose calibration (to be updated with sensor specs).
If NDEF mode is chosen, parse NDEF text record to extract ADC value.
Validate ADC result (0 to 16383) and handle outliers.
3. Authentication Requirements
Details to Pass:

Default: No authentication required for ISO/IEC 15693 read/write.
Optional Security:
JTAG disabled via Block 2, byte 6 (0x00) to prevent firmware tampering.
Custom firmware can add authentication (e.g., require a key in a custom command).
CGM Recommendation:
Implement a simple challenge-response in firmware (e.g., custom command with a shared secret).
Encrypt glucose data in the app before storage/transmission (e.g., AES-256).
Note: For medical compliance (e.g., HIPAA), secure data transmission is critical.
Action for Cursor:

Assume open access for initial implementation (read/write blocks directly).
Add hooks for future authentication (e.g., send custom command 0xAA with a key).
Encrypt glucose data in the app using a standard library (e.g., Android’s Cipher or iOS’s CryptoKit).
Ensure secure storage (e.g., Android Keystore, iOS Keychain).
4. API Specifications
Details to Pass:

No Direct API:
Use smartphone NFC APIs:
Android: android.nfc.NfcV.
iOS: CoreNFC.NFCISO15693Tag.
Communicate via ISO/IEC 15693 commands (write/read blocks).
Firmware:
Use “Default” or “SensorHub” project for ROM-based ADC sampling.
Virtual registers control sampling (Block 0x00–0x02).
Results stored in Block 0x09.
Example Commands (from Section 3.6, Page 12):
Write Block 2 (configure ADC0):
text

Copy
02 21 02 00 00 2C 00 00 00 00 00
Write Block 0 (start sampling):
text

Copy
02 21 00 01 00 04 00 01 01 00 00
Read Block 0x09 (get result):
text

Copy
02 20 09
Android Example:
java

Copy
NfcV tag = NfcV.get(tagFromIntent);
byte[] writeBlock2 = {0x02, 0x21, 0x02, 0x00, 0x00, 0x2C, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00};
byte[] writeBlock0 = {0x02, 0x21, 0x00, 0x01, 0x00, 0x04, 0x00, 0x01, 0x01, 0x00, 0x00};
byte[] readBlock9 = {0x02, 0x20, 0x09};
tag.transceive(writeBlock2); // Configure ADC
tag.transceive(writeBlock0); // Start sampling
Thread.sleep(1000); // Wait 1 second
byte[] response = tag.transceive(readBlock9); // Read result
int adcResult = ((response[2] & 0xFF) << 8) | (response[1] & 0xFF); // Parse ADC
Action for Cursor:

Implement ISO/IEC 15693 command sequence using NFC APIs.
Hardcode the above commands for ADC0 (glucose sensor).
Add configuration option for NDEF mode (parse NDEF text record).
Provide sample code for Android and iOS NFC handling.
Document commands for future firmware updates.
5. Exact Steps to Read Data from the Sensor
Details to Pass:

Hardware Setup (for testing):
Glucose sensor connected to ADC0 (SV16 Pin 3, remove R16 per Table 5, Page 8).
RF430FRL152HEVM with “Default” or “SensorHub” firmware.
Passive mode or 1.5-V battery (SR626).
Command Sequence:
Configure ADC0:
Command: 02 21 02 00 00 2C 00 00 00 00 00
Purpose: Set ADC0 for glucose sensor (PGA gain = 1, CIC filter, 1024 decimation, 14-bit accuracy).
Start Sampling:
Command: 02 21 00 01 00 04 00 01 01 00 00
Purpose: Trigger one ADC0 sample (takes ~1 second).
Read Result:
Command: 02 20 09
Response: 8 bytes, e.g., [00 90 24 FF FF FF FF FF].
ADC Result: Parse bytes 1–2 (e.g., 0x2490 = 9360).
Convert to Glucose:
Voltage: (ADC_result / 16383) * 0.9 (e.g., 9360 → 0.514 V).
Glucose: Apply sensor-specific calibration (TBD, e.g., (Voltage / 0.1) * 100 for mg/dL).
Repeat:
Loop Steps 2–4 every 5 seconds for continuous monitoring.
Timing:
Wait 1 second after Write Block 0 before Read Block 0x09.
Poll every 5–15 seconds (CGM standard).
NDEF Alternative:
If using “NFC” firmware:
Read NDEF message when tag is detected.
Parse text record (e.g., “Glucose: 9360”).
Convert ADC value to glucose as above.
Action for Cursor:

Code the command sequence in the app:
Send Write Block 2 once (or on app startup).
Loop Write Block 0 → Wait 1s → Read Block 0x09 every 5 seconds.
Parse Block 0x09 response to extract ADC result.
Implement conversion logic with a placeholder calibration function.
Add UI to display glucose (mg/dL or mmol/L, user-selectable).
If NDEF mode, handle NDEF message parsing instead of block reads.
Test sequence with a mock sensor (0–0.9 V output) if glucose sensor is unavailable.
